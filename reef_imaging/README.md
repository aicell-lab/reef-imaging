# Reef Imaging

This is the main Python package for the REEF Imaging platform, containing orchestration logic, hardware control services, data management utilities, and supplementary tools.

## Key Components

### 1. Orchestration System

#### `orchestrator.py`
The main orchestration engine that coordinates all hardware and manages time-lapse experiments.

**Core Classes**:
- `OrchestrationSystem`: Main system class with task management and service coordination

**Key Features**:
- Task loading and scheduling from `config.json`
- Service proxy management (microscope, robotic arm, incubator)
- Admission-controlled busy rejection for conflicting transport and scan operations
- Health monitoring with automatic reconnection (30-second intervals)
- Critical operation protection to prevent mid-operation shutdowns
- Atomic config writes (`config.json.tmp` → `config.json`) to prevent corruption
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

**Exposed Hypha Tool APIs** (decorated with `@schema_function`):
- `ping()` — health check
- `add_imaging_task(task_definition)` — add or update a task in `config.json`
- `delete_imaging_task(task_name)` — remove a task
- `pause_imaging_task(task_name)` / `resume_imaging_task(task_name)` — pause/resume scheduling
- `get_all_imaging_tasks()` — list all tasks from `config.json`
- `get_runtime_status()` — active operations, held resources, connected devices, critical services
- `get_incubator_samples()` — slot metadata for operator-side sample selection
- `cancel_microscope_scan()` / `halt_robotic_arm()` — emergency operator controls
- `get_lab_video_stream_urls()` — public Hypha URLs for all camera feeds
- `process_timelapse_offline_api(experiment_id)` — offline stitch + upload
- `scan_microscope_only_api(microscope_id, scan_config)` — scan without transport

#### `orchestrator_simulation.py`
Simulation version for testing without hardware. Provides mock responses for all hardware operations.

### 2. Hardware Control (`control/`)

#### Robotic Arm (`dorna-control/`)

**Main Files**:
- `start_hypha_service_robotic_arm.py` — Hypha service wrapper
- `dorna_controller.py` — Direct robot control interface
- `paths/` — JSON files with predefined movement paths

**Hypha service ID**: `robotic-arm-control` (hardcoded in orchestrator)

**Key APIs**:
- `transport_plate(from_device, to_device)` — Unified transport API
- `get_status()`

#### Incubator (`cytomat-control/`)

**Main Files**:
- `start_hypha_service_incubator.py` — Hypha service wrapper
- `samples.json` — Sample metadata and tracking database

**Hypha service ID**: `incubator-control` (hardcoded in orchestrator)

**Key APIs**:
- `put_sample_from_transfer_station_to_slot(slot_id, sample_info)`
- `get_sample_from_slot_to_transfer_station(slot_id)`
- `get_status()` — system health and current operations
- `get_temperature()` / `get_co2_level()`
- `add_sample(slot_id, sample_info)` / `remove_sample(slot_id)`

#### Microscope (`squid-control/`)
External package with built-in mirror functionality. See: https://github.com/aicell-lab/squid-control

**Hypha service IDs** (configured in `config.json`):
- `microscope-squid-1`
- `microscope-squid-2`
- `microscope-squid-plus-3`

#### Mirror Services (`mirror-services/`)

**Files**:
- `mirror_robotic_arm.py` — Cloud-to-local proxy for robotic arm
- `mirror_incubator.py` — Cloud-to-local proxy for incubator

Note: The microscope no longer needs a mirror service — `squid_control` includes built-in mirror functionality.

### 3. Data Management (`hypha_tools/`)

#### Artifact Manager (`artifact_manager/`)
Tools for uploading and organizing data on the Hypha platform.

**Key Features**:
- Concurrent batch file uploads
- Gallery and dataset creation
- Zarr file channel-based uploads
- Resume capability for interrupted transfers

#### Automated Uploaders
- `automated_treatment_uploader.py` — Uploads time-lapse experiment data with metadata
- `automated_stitch_uploader.py` — Processes and uploads stitched images

### 4. Lab Live Stream (`lab_live_stream/`)

**Files**:
- `lab_cameras.py` — Auto-detects + registers 2 USB lab cameras
- `realsense_camera.py` — RealSense camera for robotic arm
- `hamilton_camera.py` — Hamilton Windows camera
- `lab_cameras_watchdog.py` — Linux watchdog (systemctl restart)
- `hamilton_watchdog.py` — Windows watchdog (sc stop/start)

### 5. Supplementary Tools (`tools/`)
Image stitching, multi-resolution pyramid generation, format conversion (TIFF, OME-Zarr), channel merging, intensity normalization.

### 6. Utilities (`utils/`)
Common helper functions used across the package.

## Configuration

### Task Configuration (`config.json`)

The orchestrator reads from `reef_imaging/config.json`. This file is gitignored and must exist at runtime.

```json
{
    "samples": [
        {
            "name": "my-experiment",
            "settings": {
                "scan_mode": "full_automation",
                "saved_data_type": "raw_images_well_plate",
                "incubator_slot": 3,
                "allocated_microscope": "microscope-squid-1",
                "time_start_imaging": "2025-01-01T10:00:00",
                "time_end_imaging": "2025-01-07T10:00:00",
                "imaging_interval": 3600,
                "wells_to_scan": ["A1", "B2"],
                "Nx": 3,
                "Ny": 3,
                "dx": 0.3,
                "dy": 0.3,
                "illumination_settings": [...],
                "do_contrast_autofocus": true,
                "do_reflection_af": false
            },
            "operational_state": {
                "status": "pending"
            }
        }
    ],
    "microscopes": [
        { "id": "microscope-squid-1" },
        { "id": "microscope-squid-2" },
        { "id": "microscope-squid-plus-3" }
    ]
}
```

**Scan Modes**:
- `full_automation` — uses incubator + robotic arm + microscope
- `microscope_only` — imaging only, no transport

**Data Types**:
- `raw_images_well_plate` — grid-based well plate scanning
- `raw_image_flexible` — custom position-based imaging

**Task Status Values**: `pending`, `started`, `completed`, `uploading`, `paused`, `error`

**Notes**:
- `incubator-control` and `robotic-arm-control` IDs are hardcoded in orchestrator — not in `config.json`
- Microscope IDs must match entries in the `"microscopes"` array

## Usage

### Starting the Orchestrator

**Production** (cloud operation):
```bash
cd reef_imaging
python orchestrator.py
```

**Local Development**:
```bash
python orchestrator.py --local
```

**Simulation** (no hardware):
```bash
python orchestrator_simulation.py --local
```

### Critical Hardware Smoke Test

The package now includes `reef-hardware-smoke-test`, a real lab verification CLI for incubator transport, robotic arm motion, and short microscope scans across all configured microscopes.

This test is **critical** and MUST only be run when a responsible operator is **physically on site in the lab**. It is not an unattended CI-style check. The operator must be ready to stop the run if any unsafe motion or unexpected hardware state is observed.

Run it only after the local hardware services and the orchestrator are already running:

```bash
reef-hardware-smoke-test
```

The tool connects to the running local orchestrator, lists available incubator samples, lets the user pick 1 to 5 samples, asks for confirmation before each cycle, stops on the first failure, and writes a timestamped report under `hardware_test_reports/`.

### Starting Hardware Services

**Incubator**:
```bash
cd reef_imaging/control/cytomat-control
python start_hypha_service_incubator.py
```

**Robotic Arm**:
```bash
cd reef_imaging/control/dorna-control
python start_hypha_service_robotic_arm.py
```

**Mirror Services** (for cloud operation):
```bash
cd reef_imaging/control/mirror-services
python mirror_incubator.py &
python mirror_robotic_arm.py &
```

## Logging & Monitoring

Rotating log files (10 MB max, 5 backups):

| Log File | Service |
|----------|---------|
| `orchestrator.log` | Orchestrator |
| `incubator_service.log` | Incubator control |
| `robotic_arm_service.log` | Robotic arm control |
| `mirror_incubator_service.log` | Incubator mirror |
| `mirror_robotic_arm_service.log` | Robotic arm mirror |

- Health checks every 30 seconds with automatic reconnection
- Critical operation protection prevents shutdown mid-transfer
